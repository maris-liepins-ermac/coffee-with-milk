### Homework description
In order to see how this works, just run the index.php file.

I don't think comments in code are fine, but I left some just to explain why I've done certain things in certain places.

This is just minimal working version that does the things asked in the task. I should extend the money model with more methods to properly work with money (division, subtraction etc...), but since such things were not required in the task, I did not implement them.

If any extra functionality is needed, will do upon request.
